# Leanne's LSST notebooks

This repository contains my notebooks for using the LSST DM software to do science analyses. It should be possible to run all notebooks within the LSST JupyterLab environment

## Setup

Start a  jupyterlab session and start a terminal

```
cd ~/notebooks
git clone https://github.com/leannep/lsst-leanne-notebooks.git
```

In your JupyterLab fileviewer you should now see a directory called lsst-leanne-notebooks where you will find the notebooks in this repository
